# http_endpoints_healthcheck

## About this Project

> This program checks the health of a set of HTTP endpoints. It reads an input argument from a file path with a list of HTTP endpoints in YAML format, tests the health of the endpoints in 15 second test cycles and displays results of the availability percentage of the HTTP root domains being monitored by the program.
